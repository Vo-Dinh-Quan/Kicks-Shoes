## 🚀 Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repo to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/nguyenphan407/Kicks.git
cd Kicks
```

### 2. Setting Up the Front-end

#### Navigate to the `fe` folder:

```bash
cd fe
```

#### Install front-end dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

#### Start the Front-end Development Server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

- The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
- The admin will be accessible at `http://localhost:5174`.

Note: The admin folder setup is similar to the fe (front-end) folder.


### 3. Setting Up the Back-end

#### Navigate to the `be` folder:

```bash
cd ../be
```

#### Install back-end dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

#### Create the `.env` file for Laravel configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Setting Up the Database

1. **Create a MySQL Database**:
   - Open MySQL and create a new database for the project:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE kicks_shoes_db;
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can create a database using a MySQL client like **phpMyAdmin** or **MySQL Workbench**.

2. **Configure Database in `.env`**:
   - Open the `.env` file in the `be` folder, and update the following lines to match your database credentials:
     ```plaintext
     DB_CONNECTION=mysql
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_DATABASE=kicks_shoes_db
     DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
     DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
     ```

3. **Run Migrations**:
   - After configuring the database, run migrations to create the necessary tables:
     ```bash
     php artisan migrate
     ```
   - This will create the tables needed for products, users, orders, etc., in your `your_database` database.

#### Generate application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

#### Start the Back-end Server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 5. Instructions for New Team Members

2. **Sync with the remote repo**: Before starting any new work or when you see remote changes, pull the latest updates:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
3. **Push your code to the repo**:
   - Pull any latest changes to avoid conflicts:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```
   - Then push your own changes:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

### 6. Additional Configurations (if applicable)
